                On April 18, 2023, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-cards-new-high-yield-savings-account-is-now-available-offering-a-4-point-15-percent-apy/">announced that Apple Card has released a Savings Account feature.</a>
                Starting yesterday, the savings account will start with an initial APY of 4.15%, which is 10x the national average of US banks.
                This account will have no fees, minimum deposits and no minimum balance requirements.
                The feature will allow users to open a high-yield savings account from Goldman Sachs in their wallet app on their iPhone and start earning interest on their daily cash balance.
                They can also earn interest by adding personal funds deposited into the savings account via apple cash, or via a linked bank account.
